Hello! I am a PhD Student 
at the [Institute of Science and Technology Austria](https://www.ist.ac.at/home) (ISTA),
supervised by [Christoph Lampert](https://cvml.ista.ac.at/).

I am interested in interpretability and robustness in Computer Vision.
I'm currently working on certifiably robust models, and try to improve various aspects of 1-Lipschitz networks.

Find me on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/berndprach),
